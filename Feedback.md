    Is the main purpose of the app clear?
    It apears to be simple to understand, but i have a question about other exercises besides weights... like treadmill or such. Or is the focus on Weights Training?

    Are all the entities understandable? 
    All enterties are understandable, but could be expanded upon. goal could have a target date for the goal for example.. and you could include optional data for distance and time for things like cycling and running etc. depending on how complex you want to get.

    Especially how the 'goal' entity works?
    At the moment with Weight Training focus the goal makes sense, I feel if the goal was updated based off of exercises completed it would be more functional. You could tie this into a workout completed or failed attribute in workout i think.. and then make a route to update goals. 

Action required: 
- I've already stated that the API will focus on weight training only, cardio and body weight exercises will be implemented in the future.
- Will include target date for goal.
- Make goal status dynamic if goal is achieved to change itself. (Maybe a future implementation depending on time)
